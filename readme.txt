Add some fleeting time flag to your post according to the post time

== Description ==

I have used WordPress to write a personal blog for several years, probably from the freshman until after graduation.
Every time I read some posts which created long time ago, I always feel that how naive I was for that time. But I can't delete them since it's my words. 
So, I wrote this little plug-in, you can add a small tag for different periods of time to show your situation when you created that post, to provide a better reference for the reader. Some time you write a number of technical articles or software use tutorial, may have been a long time technology has changed, you can also use this plugin to mark what has been changed.
Because it is the first time to write a WordPress plugin, even I has a long experience in using wordpress, but I still not very familiar with WordPress plugin API, and also don't know how to make this thing have much practical significance.
If you have any comments, or there is a need for the needs of WordPress plugin development, all can email to me @im@andy-cheung.me, thanks!
